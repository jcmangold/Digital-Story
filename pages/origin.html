                The Joker, Batman’s arch nemesis, Gotham City’s psychopathic villain, the GCPD’s relentless nightmare;
                The man who infects his victims with a gas that forces uncontrollable laughter until one dies with a
                smile plastered permanently on their face, his genius
                schemes put the rest of Batman’s <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A Rogues Gallery is the list of all the villains he has fought throughout his history. 
                Batman has one of the most extensive Rogues Galleries of any superhero."><u>Rogues Gallery</u></span> to shame. But where did this maniac come from and how
                did he become so messed up?
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the Joker originally appeared in the first issue of <em>Batman</em>, published in 1940, his
                origin wasn’t explored until issue 168, a full eleven years after the Joker’s first appearance. In
                this issue, Bill Finger, the main Batman writer at the time, revealed that the Joker had once been
                a criminal known as Red Hood. During a heated encounter with Batman, Red Hood stumbled into a vat
                of chemicals that gave him his infamous green hair and white skin, turning him into the Joker.
                Later, in 1988, writer Alan Moore took inspiration from this story when he wrote the well-known
                novel, <em>The Killing Joke</em>, which is now widely accepted as the Joker’s true origin.
            </p>
            <p>
                The story begins like most older Batman and Joker comics end, with the Joker locked up in Arkham
                Asylum. Batman visits the Joker’s cell and tries to reason with the clown, telling him that eventually,
                one of them is going to die. Batman felt the need to know that he tried at least once to reason with the
                Joker and save countless lives. But something felt off to the detective. Joker hadn’t spoken a word
                throughout the entire encounter; he simply continued to deal out a set of playing cards. Frustrated,
                Batman grabbed the Joker’s hand as it placed down yet another card and exclaimed, “[a]re you even
                listening to me? It’s life and death that I’m discussing here” (Moore 10). Noticing the white smear
                on his palm, Batman suddenly realized what was wrong and lunged for the man in front of him, demanding
                to know what happened to the real Joker.
            </p>
            <div class="middle_image">
                <img src="../images/death.jpg" alt="Joker Movie">
            </div>
            <p>
                While Batman was wasting his time at the asylum, the Joker was preparing for his next big scheme:
                proving that all it took to turn a person insane was, “one bad day”; And his test subject was Jim
                Gordon, GCPD’s commissioner and longtime supporter of Batman(Moore 44). It’s just as Joker told Batman later in the book, “when I saw what a black, awful joke the world was, I went crazy as a coot” (Moore 45).As the Joker executes his master plan of torturing Jim Gordon, we are shown
                flashbacks of the man the Joker used to be before he went mad. We see that the Joker had quit his
                job at ACE Chemicals to become a comedian. But it wasn’t going so well. He wasn’t getting many job
                opportunities and the rent was due. On top of this, the Joker was trying to support his wife and
                unborn child. In desperation, he agreed to help break into ACE Chemical Labs with two other men.
                They gave him a red helmet, saying that if he wore it, no one would know who he was, mistaking him
                for a criminal known as the Red Hood. It would just be this once, he told himself, and then he could
                start a “proper” life with his wife and child (Moore 22).
            </p>
            <div class="middle_image">
                <img src="../images/ProperLife.jpg" alt="Joker Movie">
            </div>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, he would never get that chance. As the Joker remembers it, he was approached by an
                officer and informed that his wife and unborn child had passed away in an electrical accident.
                Distraught, the Joker hurried back to the two men he made a deal with and pleaded with them to
                let him back out of their deal. However, the men weren’t going to let him go so easily. They
                even threatened to kill the Joker if he tried to back out now.
            </p>
            <p>
                Consequently, the Joker was forced to go along with the robbery. However, the three men were spotted by a guard
                during the break-in and the two crooks were shot. As the Joker fled for his life and the guards pursued,
                about to open fire again, Batman arrived and told the guards there would be no more shooting because he
                would handle the rest. In a desperate attempt to escape Batman, the Joker threw himself into a large vat
                of chemicals. He was spit out through a drainage tunnel and washed up on a bank. Taking off his helmet,
                the Joker took in his green hair and white skin reflecting at him from a puddle. Slowly, his red lips formed
                a hideous smile and he broke into uncontrollable laughter. The Joker had been born.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here is the scene from the movie adaptation of the <em>Killing Joke</em> that illustrates
                the Joker's origin. In this clip we see batman chase a man through Ace Chemical Labs and watch as he falls into the chemicals and transform into the Joker.
                It is here when the man sees himself in a puddle that we first heae the Joker's iconic laugh.
            </p>

            <p>
                But wait, the Joker is mentally insane. And we're basing this origin off of his memories.
                Can we even trust these memories? It’s like Joker said when Batman was chasing him through a
                carnival in the <em>Killing Joke</em>: “I’m not exactly sure. Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes
                another” (Moore 45). So what do you think? Is this the Joker’s origin? Or did he just make it up? Do you like how the writers left the Joker's story open? Or do would you have preferred a more concrete origin?
                In any case, it’s genius how the writers give us an origin for one of DC’s most mysterious villains
                and yet at the same time leave it uncertain and open for debate. So maybe we don’t truly know the
                Joker’s origin, and though we can certainly come up with wild theories, this is definitely the
                closest we’ve gotten to an origin story for the Joker so far.
