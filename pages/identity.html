                Who is the most mysterious DC character? Some might say it’s <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Faceless detective and martial artist, Vic Sage battles corrupt officials and
                politicians and has even been on the Justice League. You can read his six issue long miniseries called The Question."><u>The Question</u></span>, or the godlike <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="God-like being formally known as Jim Corrigan, who was brutally murdered.
                Instead of going on to the afterlife, Jim’s spirit took the form of the Spectre to take vengeance on evil."><u>Spectre</u></span>, maybe <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A powerful sorcerer, Constantine allied himself with Batman in the Injustice comics
                series when the Justice League split up. He is a strong ally and went up against gods in Injustice.
                "><u>John Constantine</u></span>,
                or even the Dark Knight himself. But what about the Joker? Every Character mentioned above, aside from the Joker, has had their
                identities and origins revealed at some point. While, yes, the Joker has had numerous origins and aliases, none of these stories
                have been explicitly confirmed. For all we know, the Joker is just a no-name lunatic who enjoys causing chaos in Gotham City.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although the Joker doesn’t currently have an identity, that could very easily change in the future. And that raises an abundance of
                questions such as: Should the Joker have an identity? Does the added mystery improve his character, or would it be better to place a
                name behind the face? Or maybe his identity isn’t even what matters at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, the Joker hasn’t had a name since he was created. Nobody knows who he really is. And, as I mentioned above, that adds to his character's
                overall mystery. To put it simply, anyone could be the Joker. And that fits exactly with the idea behind the Joker’s character. It’s this idea
                that anyone can become as insane as the Joker. All it takes is one bad day. In the illustrated novel, <em>The Killing Joke</em>, the Joker is trying to
                prove that, “all it takes is one bad day to reduce the sanest man alive to lunacy” (Moore 44). Having no name is the perfect embodiment of this
                concept because no one knows who the Joker is, and that means he could be anyone. In addition, there is the contrast between the Joker and Batman.
                They both lived through a nightmare, Bruce Wayne with the death of his parents and the Joker with, allegedly, the death of his wife and unborn
                child, yet they both reacted differently. While Bruce Wayne turned to fighting the evil that caused his parents' death, the Joker embraced the
                madness he saw in society. In <em>The Killing Joke</em>, The Joker tells Batman that “when [he] saw what a black, awful joke the world was, [he] went
                crazy as a coot” (Moore 45).
            </p>
            <p>
                Watch this clip of the end of the animated movie, The Killing Joke. This is
                the part near the end of the book where the Joker is explaining to Batman that
                everyone is the same. Anyone could have gone mad with the Joker's experience.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p>
                Another aspect behind the Joker’s unknown origin is that it makes him ten times more dangerous. Without a backstory, the Joker has no motivation
                or reason for being evil. He’s just evil for the sake of being evil, and this makes him unpredictable, unlike other Batman villains such as Poison
                Ivy, Scarecrow, and Ra's Al Ghul. These characters all have a purpose behind their evil schemes. Poison Ivy’s love for nature leads her to do
                anything within her power to save the planet. Scarecrow became the master of fear so that he would never be afraid again. Even Ras thinks he’s
                helping purge the world of evil in his own twisted way. In all this evil there is some amount of order and pattern. But the Joker has no pattern
                except to make Batman suffer. He’s just plain crazy. In his book, <em>The Art of War</em>, Sun Tzu says, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need
                not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat”
                (Tzu 3:18). It is the idea that to defeat your enemy, you need to first understand them. Yet no one, not even Batman, can understand the Joker.
                He is deathly unpredictable and crazy.
            </p>
            <h2>The Joker Movie</h2>
            <div class="middle_image">
                <img src="../images/joker_movie.jpg" alt="Joker Movie">
            </div>
            <p>
                I believe the Joker movie, released in 2019, is an excellent example of cleverly incorporating the Joker’s identity into a storyline. During the
                movie, the Joker, Arthur Fleck, struggles with the discovery that his dad is Thomas Wayne. He even confronts Thomas about it but is stunned when
                Thomas plainly denies being his father, insisting that Arthur was adopted. This is absolutely genius storytelling. Throughout the majority of the
                movie, the audience is led to believe that Arthur Fleck is the Joker but then, near the end, as Arthur is descending further into the character of
                the Joker, he suddenly finds out that he was adopted. He is just a nobody with no biological parents. This movie portrays Arthur slowly descending
                further and further into chaos, embracing the madness and rebelling against society, and as he does so, he loses himself in the process, becoming
                the Joker.

                Identity and origin are undoubtedly major aspects of any character. However, it is not these two facets of a person that dictate how they will
                act or respond in certain situations, instead, it is the actions that define a person’s identity. The Joker’s actions speak clearly for themselves.
                It wouldn’t make a difference if his name was Jack or Arthur, or if he fell into a vat of chemicals or not, the Joker is still the Joker. Batman
                doesn’t need to know the Joker’s real name or what his backstory is because he already knows who the Joker is right now and that is what matters.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his Three Jokers storyline, Geoff Johns does a terrific job of highlighting the Joker’s characteristics and looking past his identity. Johns
                sets up this series in Justice League #42, where Batman gains access to the Mobius Chair, a chair with infinite knowledge that will answer any
                question you ask. First, to test the chair’s knowledge, Batman asks the Mobius Chair who killed his parents. The chair replies to Batman saying
                that Joe Chill killed his parents. Satisfied, Batman asks the one question everyone has been dying to know: Who is the Joker? Batman is shocked
                by the chair's answer muttering to himself that it’s impossible. At the end of the story, the readers finally learn that the Mobius Chair revealed
                to Batman that there are in fact, not one, but three Jokers.

                <img src="../images/mobius.jpg" alt="Three Jokers">
            </div>
            <p>
                This issue then leads into the Three Jokers series which explores the three different Jokers and classifies them as the Criminal, the Clown, and the
                Psychopath. Each Joker is from a different age of comic books. The Criminal is a darker Joker from the Golden Age (1938-1950) of comics where content
                was less censored and contained more mature content. The Clown comes from the Silver Age (1956-1970) of comics when the Comic Code Authority was formed,
                putting heavy restrictions on what content was allowed to be published. This led to less serious comics and a silly Joker. Finally, the Psychopath
                emerged in the Bronze Age (1970-1985) of comics when the restrictions of comics subsided a bit and more serious content was published. Now, this idea
                of three Jokers is genius not only because it explains the drastic changes the Joker’s character went through throughout his history, but because it
                focuses on the Joker’s characteristics and not his actual name or identity. It shows that the Joker is defined by how he acts.

                In the third and final book of the Three Jokers series, Alfred asks Batman if they will ever find out who the real Joker is. Batman responds saying,
                “Not to sound like people think I do, Alfred, but I’m Batman. I knew the Joker’s name one week after we first met” (Johns 49). Here, it is revealed
                that the Joker’s wife from the <em>The Killing Joke</em> hadn’t actually died in an electrical accident. It turns out, the Joker had been an abusive husband and
                his wife was afraid he was going to hurt their child so the cops helped her fake her death and move her away from the Joker. Batman knew that if
                anyone found out she was the wife of the Joker, her and her son's life would be ruined. The public would find them, and worst of all, Joker would
                find them. But Batman also understood something else. He knew that the Joker’s name didn’t matter. Batman tells Alfred, “Yes, I know his name. But
                the Joker’s name isn’t what’s important. It never has been”(Johns 50).

            <p>
                Now, all this is not to say that the Joker should never ever, ever have his identity revealed. Not at all! There have been numerous instances when
                openly revealing the Joker’s identity has been okay and even beneficial. One such example is found in the White Knight comic series. In this
                universe, the Joker gives Batman some pills saying that if Joker takes them, he will get better and he can save Gotham. So, Batman forces the
                pills down Joker’s throat, not expecting them to work but, surprisingly, they do. Turns out, he was just an ordinary guy named Jack Napier. Jack is
                able to convince the GCPD of his innocence and is even able to turn the GCPD against Batman, saying that he is a menace. In the end, Jack turns back
                into the Joker, and Batman is released. But you can see that giving the Joker a name helped humanize him. It made the readers sympathize with the
                Joker instead of Batman. We could finally see the Joker’s side of the story and realize how messed up and violent Batman was in this universe. By
                giving the Joker a name, the writers were giving him personality and making it easier for us, as readers, to relate to him.
            </p>
            <p class="last_para">
                And yet, maybe that’s why the Joker doesn’t have an identity. The Joker is not supposed to be a relatable character. He’s too mad to be humanized.
                But what do you think? Should the Joker have an identity? Or is it better to be left a secret? Either way, I believe the Joker will always be one
                of the most fascinating characters to ever be created in comic book history.
