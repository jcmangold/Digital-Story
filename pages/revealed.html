                The Joker is arguably one of the greatest superhero villains to ever exist. One aspect of his character that makes him so popular
                is his identity; or lack thereof. Until recently, the Joker’s identity has been kept largely anonymous. Of course, there have been
                many fan theories and even a couple of storylines where the  Joker has been given a name. One such instance being in the 
                <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Batman origin movie directed by Tim Burton where Batman faces off against Jack Napier, also known as the Joker. This was the Joker's first appearance in a live-action movie.">
                <u>Batman 1989 movie</u></span>. However, despite such stories, the Joker’s identity has been primarily kept a secret. But again, this was up until recently.
            </p>
            <p>
                In issue #5 of Flashpoint Beyond, it is revealed to Thomas Wayne that the Joker’s name is Jack Oswald White. Martha Wayne, currently
                the Joker in the Flashpoint universe, tells Batman, Thomas Wayne, that she forced the <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A Batman villain whose mask allows him to control anyone’s
                emotions, including gods. He once allied with Bane to help him overcome his addiction to the drug, Venom."><u>Psycho Pirate</u></span> to reveal the Joker’s identity. Martha then relates how she visited Jack White and found that in her universe, 
                he was just a normal guy working as a janitor at a Wayne
                Casino to support his wife and kids.
            </p>
            <div class="middle_image">

                Here is a video from VariantComics in which Arris Quinones reviews the Joker's identity reveal.
                Arris Quinones relates his thoughts on the matter as well as giving an in depth review on various Joker identities.
                Quinones beleives that Jack Oswald Napier is the Joker's cannon name but can we really be sure?

            </p>
            <div class="middle_vid">
                <video controls src="../videos/The Jokers Real Name Revealed!.mp4" width="500"></video>
            </div>
            <p>
                So there it is. Jack Oswald White is the Joker. But is he? Justin Epps from ScreenRant points out that, “nearly every time the Joker’s
                real name has come out, it’s always been in another world or timeline” (“Joker’s True Identity Changes Everything”). And that’s just it:
                We don’t know if this is the identity of the Joker in the Main DC universe. Consequently, this leaves the possibilities open for writers
                in the future. The next comic issue or movie could take up this identity of the Joker or, just as easily, ignore this name, labeling it
                as just one more name that the Joker has gone by in the past.
            </p>
            <p>
                So that brings us to the critical question: Should DC give the Joker an identity? On one hand, this might take away from the overall mystery
                of the Joker’s Character. But his identity was bound to come out eventually right? He is the arch-nemesis of the world’s greatest detective
                after all.
            </p>
            <p>
                But what do you think?
